\bsc{Theorem 3.3: The Completeness Axiom}{
Recall the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic: \

if n $\in \bn$ with n $\geq$ 2, then n may be expressed as the product of prime numbers (the prime factorization (PF)). \

The PF is unique with respect to (WRT) order. \

Ex: $12 = 2 * 2 * 2 * 3$
}
\bsc{Theorem 3.3.1}{
\lt{p be a prime number} \

Then $\sqrt{p} \in $ \bnt{\br}{\bq} \
\bgpf

\as{$\sqrt{p} \in \bq$} \

Then $\sqrt{p}$ = $\frac{a}{b}$, where a, b $\in \bn$ and gcd(a, b) $=$ 1 \

So, \

p $= \frac{a^2}{b^2}$ \

$a^2 = pb^2$ \

therefore,

\step{p | a^2}{1}

$p | a^2$ $\rar$ $\exists k \in \bz$ st $a^2 = pk$ \

Since the PF of $a^2$ and a contain exactly the same distinct primes, \

(i.e. a $=$ p$_1 \times $ p$_2 \times$ ... p$_n$ $\rar$ a$^2 =$ p$^2_1 \times$ p$^2_2 \times$ ... $p^2_n$) \

and since p is prime (i.e. p is a component of a$^2$ but can't be, say, p$^2_2$ because that would mean it has an integer square root and therefore isn't prime), it has to be one of the p$_n$'s,

p $|$ a.

Thus, $\exists$ k $\in \bz$ st. a $=$ pk. \

Then a$^2$ = p$^2$k$^2$ = pb$^2$ from \bpth{1}.

Thus, b$^2$ = pk$^2$, and we see that p $|$ b$^2$. \

However, we obtain the contradiction that p $|$ b and p $|$ a. \

Hence, $\sqrt{p} \in \bi$.

\bsc{Definition 3.3.7}{
Let S $\sbs \br$.

If $\exists$ m $\in \br$ st s $\leq$ m $\fa$ s $\in S$, \

then m is an upper bound of S and we say that S is \textbf{bounded above}. \

Similarly, we can define \textbf{bounded below}. \

If S is bounded above and below, then S is said to be \textbf{bounded}.

S can be open or closed. The example below is closed.

\

\begin{tikzpicture}

\draw[latex-latex] (-3.5,0) -- (3.5,0) ; %edit here for the axis
\foreach \x in  {-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3} % edit here for the vertical lines
\draw[shift={(\x,0)},color=black] (0pt,3pt) -- (0pt,-3pt);
\foreach \x in {,,,,,,} % edit here for the numbers
\draw[shift={(\x,0)},color=black] (0pt,0pt) -- (0pt,-3pt) node[below] 
{$\x$};
\draw[*-*] (0.92,0) -- (2.08,0);
\draw[very thick] (0.92,0) -- (2.08,0);

\node [below] at (1.5,-0.3) {S};
\node [below] at (0, -0.2) {n};
\node [below] at (3, -0.2) {m};

\end{tikzpicture}

If an upper bound m of S is a member of S, then m is called the maximum (or largest element) of S, and we say that m = \textbf{max S}.

--n--[--S--m--

Similarly, we may decline \textbf{minimum of S (min S)}.

\foreach \x in  {-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3} % edit here for the vertical lines

\foreach \x in {,,,,,,} % edit here for the numbers
\draw[shift={(\x,0)},color=black] (0pt,0pt) -- (0pt,-3pt) node[below]

\bsc{Theorem 1}{
If a set S $\sbs \br$ possesses a max element, then it is unique. A similar result holds for a minimum element.
\bgpf
\supp{$\exists m_1, m_2 \in \br$ st $m_1 =$ max S, $m_2 = $ max S}

Thus, $m_1$, $m_2 \in S$ and, $\fa s \in$ S

\step{s \leq m_1}{1}
\step{s \leq m_2}{2}

Let max $=$ \uw{m}{1} in \bpth{1} and max $=$ \uw{m}{2} in \bpth{2} to obtain that \uw{m}{2} $\leq$ \uw{m}{1} and \uw{m}{1} $\leq$ \uw{m}{2}, \

Hence, \uw{m}{1} \eql \uw{m}{2}. 
\epf
}
\bsc{Definition 3.3.5 (supremum defined)}{
Let \es $\neq$ S \sbs \br if S is bounded above, \

then the \textbf{least upper bound} of S is called the \textbf{supremum} of S, denoted by sup S \mem \br \

iff: \

\balist
\item s $\leq$ sup S \fa s \mem S
\item \exs s' \mem S st sup S $-$ \ep $<$ s' \fa \ep $>$ 0
\elist

\ssc{Axiom of Completeness of the set of Real Numbers: \br}{
Every \es $\neq$ S \sbs \br that is bounded above has a least upper bound (i.e. sup S \mem \br exists). \

A similar statement can be made about inf S.
}

Remark: In practice 3.3.4, the set T \eql \{q \mem \bq : $0 \leq q \leq \sqrt{2}$\} is bounded.

\foreach \x in  {-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3} % edit here for the vertical lines
\draw[shift={(\x,0)},color=black] (0pt,3pt) -- (0pt,-3pt);
\foreach \x in {,,,,,,} % edit here for the numbers
\draw[shift={(\x,0)},color=black] (0pt,0pt) -- (0pt,-3pt) node[below]

\draw[*-o] (0.92,0) -- (2.08,0);
\draw[very thick] (0.92,0) -- (1.92,0);

\node [below] at (1, -0.2) {$0$};
\node [below] at (2, -0.12) {$\sqrt{2}$};

\end{tikzpicture}

\newpage

But $\sqrt{2}$ is not rational, so the set wouldn't have a least upper bound.

We need to fill in the gaps to make analysis work.
