# joshualmitchell.github.io

This repository acts as the source code for my website in general, but since it's mostly work done during my Master's degree with a few side projects, it's also the repository I use for class work.

At some point after I graduate, it'll make more sense to have one repository for my website and one for my M.S. related work. When that happens, I'll separate them (maybe I should have done that from the start? Oh well).
