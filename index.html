<p>Hi! My name's Joshua Lelon Mitchell. Welcome to my site.

<p>It's a little barebones at the moment, but slowly, over time, it'll be better.</p>

<p>One of my favorite things is the challenge of explaining concepts generally considered complex in such a way that it's digestible and accessible by most of humanity. I'm incredibly inspired by universities like Stanford and MIT that have released hundreds of courses taught by world class professors to the public for free, and by organizations like <a href="distill.io">distill.io</a>, whose goal is to explain machine learning in the least frustrating and most intuitive way possible. For similar reasons, I greatly admire folks like <a href="http://karpathy.github.io/">Andrej Karpathy</a> and <a href="http://colah.github.io/">Chris Olah</a>, whose blogs I regularly read.</p> 

<p>I intend to give back in a similar manner, with content on par with theirs. This is highly subject to change, depending on what pain points I see in the world's understanding of subjects I'm interested in, but right now my three immediate goals are:
<ul>
	<li>to post all my <a href="https://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a> lecture notes (starting with real analysis),</li>
	<li>to post a simple but highly intuitive explanation of neural networks (I've noticed that all the explanations and tutorials I've seen still tend to overcomplicate it a little bit - I'm talking about literally using data sets with maybe 3 or 4 data points to start with, each being a 1x1 pixel array, so that it's just enough to get the point across, but a small enough quantity that the math can be done right in front of most people without having to be studied for more than a few minutes), and</li>
	<li>to post an explanation of why, in statistics, the sample variance is divided by n-1 instead of n (mostly because I don't viscerally understand it yet, despite doing the math and deriving it).</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>My analysis notes are <a href="/2017/09/22/my-analysis-notes-in-latex.html">here</a>.

Thanks for visiting!</p>
