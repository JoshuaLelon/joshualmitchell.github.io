<p>Hi! My name's Joshua Lelon Mitchell.</p>

<p>My goal is to bring as much value to as many people as possible through programming and data science. Welcome to my webpage.</p>

<p>One of my favorite things is the challenge of explaining concepts generally considered complex in such a way that they're digestible and accessible by most of humanity. I'm incredibly inspired by universities like Stanford and MIT that have released hundreds of courses taught by world class professors to the public for free, and by organizations like <a href="https://distill.pub/">distill.pub</a>, whose goal is to explain machine learning in the least frustrating and most intuitive way possible. For similar reasons, I greatly admire folks like <a href="http://karpathy.github.io/">Andrej Karpathy</a> and <a href="http://colah.github.io/">Chris Olah</a>, whose blogs I regularly read.</p> 

<p>Thanks for visiting!</p>
