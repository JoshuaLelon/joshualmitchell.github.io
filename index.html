<p>Hi! My name's Joshua Mitchell. Welcome to my site.</p>

<p>It's a little barebones at the moment, but slowly, over time, it'll look better.</p>

<p>I resonate with the idea of all knowledge being open, accessible, and digestible by all of humanity, so I'm going to release as much knowledge as I can that I find important (or otherwise interesting to the masses) in the most intuitive way possible.</p>

<p>My three immediate goals are to post all my lecture notes, to post an explanation of neural networks, and to post an explanation of why, in statistics, the sample variance is divided by n-1 instead of n.</p>

<p>Analysis 1 Lecture Notes in LaTeX:</p>

<p>Lecture 1: [<a href="MATH3380-8-29.html">pdf</a>] [<a href="MATH3380-8-29.html">src (latex)</a>] (doesn't work yet - working on it)</p>
