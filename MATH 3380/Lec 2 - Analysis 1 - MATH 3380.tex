\bsc{Theorem 3.3: The Completeness Axiom}{
Recall the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic: \

if n $\in \bn$ with n $\geq$ 2, then n may be expressed as the product of prime numbers (the prime factorization (PF)). \

The PF is unique with respect to (WRT) order. \

Ex: $12 = 2 * 2 * 2 * 3$
}
\bsc{Theorem 3.3.1}{
\lt{p be a prime number} \

Then $\sqrt{p} \in $ $\butnot{$\br$}{$\bq$}$ \
\bgpf

\as{$\sqrt{p} \in \bq$} \

Then $\sqrt{p}$ = $\frac{a}{b}$, where a, b $\in \bn$ and gcd(a, b) $=$ 1 \

So, \

p $= \frac{a^2}{b^2}$ \

$a^2 = pb^2$ \

therefore,

\step{p | a^2}{1}

$p | a^2$ $\rar$ $\exists k \in \bz$ st $a^2 = pk$ \

Since the PF of $a^2$ and a contain exactly the same distinct primes, \

(i.e. a $=$ p$_1 \times $ p$_2 \times$ ... p$_n$ $\rar$ a$^2 =$ p$^2_1 \times$ p$^2_2 \times$ ... $p^2_n$) \

and since p is prime (i.e. p is a component of a$^2$ but can't be, say, p$^2_2$ because that would mean it has an integer square root and therefore isn't prime), it has to be one of the p$_n$'s,

p $|$ a.

Thus, $\exists$ k $\in \bz$ st. a $=$ pk. \

Then a$^2$ = p$^2$k$^2$ = pb$^2$ from \bpth{1}.

Thus, b$^2$ = pk$^2$, and we see that p $|$ b$^2$. \

However, we obtain the contradiction that p $|$ b and p $|$ a. \

Hence, $\sqrt{p} \in \bi$.

\bsc{Definition 3.3.7}{
Let S $\sbs \br$.

If $\exists$ m $\in \br$ st s $\leq$ m $\fa$ s $\in S$, \

then m is an upper bound of S and we say that S is \textbf{bounded above}. \

Similarly, we can define \textbf{bounded below}. \

If S is bounded above and below, then S is said to be \textbf{bounded}.

--n--[--S--]--m

If an upper bound m of S is a member of S, then m is called the maximum (or largest element) of S, and we say that m = \textbf{max S}.

--n--[--S--m--

Similarly, we may decline \textbf{minimum of S (min S)}.
}

\bsc{Theorem 1}{
If a set S $\sbs \br$ possesses a max element, then it is unique. A similar result holds for a minimum element.
\bgpf
\supp{$\exists m_1, m_2 \in \br$ st $m_1 =$ max S, $m_2 = $ max S}

Thus, $m_1$, $m_2 \in S$ and, $\fa s \in$ S

\step{s \leq m_1}{1}
\step{s \leq m_2}{2}

Let m $=$ m$_2$ in \bpth{1} and m $=$
