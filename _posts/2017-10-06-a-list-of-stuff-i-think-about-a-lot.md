title: "A list of stuff I think about a lot"
date: 2017-10-06

As a new graduate student, I have a ton of shallow interests with next to none of the vocabulary to articulate where I want to go with each of them. I suspect I have a deeper interest in a subset of those, but when I get asked, "What're your research interests?" - I don't have those immediately available. This tends to be a problem.

I expect that, as I learn more, new vocabulary and paths will emerge, but for now, I'd like to keep a running list of concepts I'm fascinated by and questions I've wondered about more than once. That way, at the very least, I can point to here and say, "here's what I've got so far" - possibly even learn some new vocabulary to map the concepts to. So far I know they tend to be very Mathematics/Computer Science/Logic/Language related.

The list goes (neither the lists nor the list of lists are in any particular order of importance or significance):

# General Subjects
# Concepts / Known Problems
# Questions / Unknown Concepts

## General Subjects

- Formal Languages

- Automata Theory

- Category Theory

- Type Theory

- Information Theory

- Graph Theory

- Statistics

- Artificial Intelligence

- Machine Learning

- Natural Language Processing

- Computer Vision

## Concepts / Known Problems

- The P = NP problem

- Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem (and, by extension: Tarski's undefinability theorem from Mathematical Logic)

- Kolmogorov Complexity (from Information Theory)

- Zero/One/Many Shot Learning (from Computer Vision)

## Questions / Unknown Concepts

- For all things (i.e. every person, place, idea, entity, "everything"), is it possible to create a 1 dimensional spectrum (like the real number line), such that there is a bijective function (or, maybe an algorithm) that maps each thing to a spot on the spectrum? In other words, can we order literally anything and everything in such a way that no matter what we discover, create, or think about, we can take that thing and map it to a spot on that spectrum? The moment we know something exists, can we find out where it exists on the spectrum next to everything else that exists or could possibly exist?

- What is the largest amount of incompressible information possible? This has to depend on the compressor at some point, since it would just be trivial to map all the information to one bit and then compress it to that bit. However, can we define that compressor by some compressible amount of information? Can we then compress that compressor with another compressor? Can we create a system of these in such a way that the last compressor can be compressed by the first (like a snake eating its tail)? What implications does this have for the information?

- If one proof for a statement is valid and another proof for a statement is valid (e.g. the Pythagorean Theorem has hundreds of known proofs), is it possible to find/generate an exhaustive list of all possible proofs for a certain statement and prove that list is exhaustive? How would that even begin to be researched?

- How do we create information? Is information created or discovered? In order to generate information randomly, we need categories or previously established groups. For example, generating numbers requires a list of numbers to chose from or a list of numerable properties to pick a permutation of. Generating information doesn't really seem like generating information itself, more like taking our current information and exhausting all possible combinations of its qualities. If the information is the categories itself. How do we generate new categories? Categories for categories. Where does it end, if it does? Where does it begin?

- The sum of numbers from 1 to n is equal to n(n-1)/2 - and there’s a proof for that. What other tricks are there like that? Is there a science/art/methodology of finding tricks like that? That trick only works because the numbers are ordered and evenly spaced apart - what if only one or neither is true?

- Is there a way to decide if a graph has to be at least n-dimensional based on its edges and vertices? What practical applications would this have? For example (a Q3 hypergraph):

Inline-style:

Can we flatten this such that no edges are laying on another edge? Does this mean it has to be 3D?
