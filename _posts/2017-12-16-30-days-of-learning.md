title: "30 days of learning"
date: 2017-12-16

I just completed my first semester of graduate school and began my winter break a few days ago. However, I still feel a large gap in my skills (both in terms of being able to create value for other people and academic proficiency).

So, I'm going to use the next 30 days to learn every day and post about what I learned that day.

A quick summary of what I've learned can be found here (will add in link later).

A general road map for stuff I want to touch on:

- PyTorch tutorials
- Machine Learning / Deep Learning Theory (general best data practices, neural networks (DNNs, CNNs, RNNs), and GANs)
- Alexa Skills
- Computer Vision

Day one will officially start tomorrow (December 17th, 2017).
