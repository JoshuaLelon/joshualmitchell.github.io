Since most of my exposure to machine learning in general has been through classes and theory, I decided to try a more hands-on project based method for the winter break.

Here's the book I decided to follow, which has been raved about in really techy communities like Hacker News:

I'm going to go through as much of this book as I can, and use PyTorch instead of Tensorflow as much as I can (but possibly just learn TensorFlow to start off with).

Then, after this, I'll apply it to some of my own projects (via a custom Alexa skill, maybe?) towards the end.

Here's what I've learned today:
