[J.K. Rowling's tweet](https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/1207646162813100033) has enveloped a lot of buzz. And it's got me thinking: What's fair? What's best for society here?

I'll focus around two questions:

- What's a woman?
- Are trans-women women?

## What's a woman?

My attempt to answer that question without bias:

1) Acquire the definition of a woman.

2) See if the entity in question (trans-woman) fits the definition.

Ok, so what's a woman? A human adult who has XY chromosomes?

Wait! What about X? XXY? etc?

Darn. How about presence of female sex organs?

That doesn't work either: what about people with both male and female sex organs?

What about someone with neither, but otherwise has all the hormonal and physical markers of being female? They have breasts, curves, etc.

What about someone who lost their uterus because of cancer? Are they no longer a woman?

Ok, so it's not that easy. And it's clearly an issue. 

What about genetics? I think there's a fair distinction between gender and biological sex, so let's talk about that.

Genetics are incredibly complicated, so accounting for every possibility of what could sexually occur will be hard, if not impossible.

It's still important, though, and should be done anyway.

BUT! Let's say we've solved it. We've characterized everything you could possibly be (genetically), and we have three labels:

1) males (xy, have male sex organs, no female sex organs, etc)

2) females (xx, have female sex organs, no male sex organs, etc)

3) indeterminant (anything that isn't 1 or 2), which feeds into a LARGE number of sub-categories

To be clear, when I say indeterminant, that's not derogatory. That just means, "doesn't cleanly fit into the categories most other people fit into," which is completely valid and should be acknowledged. Indeterminant isn't some faceless catch-all category. All those sub-categories should also be acknowledged as well.

Let's answer an (in my opinion) easier question:

Are trans-women female?

My working answer to that right now is: Do you fall into the female category as decided by modern biological science? If so, then yes! If not, then no.

Again, there's nothing wrong with whatever it is that you happen to be. But you shouldn't deny it. The sky is blue and the sun rises.

I'm not saying that science is perfect. Far from it. We don't even know .00000001% of what there is to know.

I'm saying that, based on current working knowledge, we, as a scientific society, have decided to give individuals with certain provable and documented qualities specific labels. If you don't have those qualities then you won't scientifically be labeled as such.

It's like trying tell your doctor that you're female when they're attempting to diagnose you with prostate cancer.

It's just not reality, and it doesn't do you any good to claim otherwise.

## Are trans-women women?

Before the pitchforks are brought out, I don't think I've touched on the heart of the issue.

Disclaimer: I'm not trans and I'm definitely not claiming to speak on that platform.

My personal observation: it's more about inclusivity and acknowledgement.

I don't think transwomen are complaining that doctors want to know what they were originally born as so they can properly treat them.

I think it's more about acknowledging their existence, their identity, and their beliefs.

### Examples:

If you're Christian, and you tell people you're Christian, you expect people, if asked what you are, to say, "Oh, that person? Yeah, they're Christian."

Even if you don't look like a stereotypical Christian. Even if you do things differently than most Christians.

Even if you weren't Christian originally, but things changed, and now you are!

If people say, "oh, yeah, they claim to be Christian," but it's accompanied by eye-rolls and dismissive hand gestures, then I think it's reasonable to be pissed off.

And I think that, just like Christianity comes in many different forms, so does womanhood. We made up the words anyway, why are they so set in stone? They're social entities.

Woman can play basketball. Men can knit. Women can lift weights. Men can put on makeup.

As far as I'm concerned, I think people should be able to align themselves with whatever *GENDER* they want to.

Biological sex? No, that's just a fact of life.

Societal labels? Absolutely!

People do it all the time. What music do you listen to? I'm a metal head. What does that even mean? Even if people debate which bands actually qualify as metal, only assholes say things like, "you're only a metal head if you listen to x, y, and z. Q doesn't count." It's an identity thing. I think "woman" and "man" fall into this category.

So to answer the question: Are trans-women women?

My answer: If they identify with that label, then yes, they are.

A few caveats:

- If people call you by a gender that you don't identify with, I don't think you necessarily have the right to be offended. Most people aren't trying to offend you. Most people don't want to think about relatively trivial things like what pronoun to use in a sentence. It's a waste of energy to be offended here, in my opinion.
- If you correct someone politely, and they don't give a shit, then yes, I definitely think you have the right to be offended. That's an asshole move.
- I don't think it should be illegal to call someone by the wrong pronoun (for the same reasons it's not illegal to call someone an asshole in general i.e. free speech).
- I do think that any tax payer funded entity (website, voting booth, portal, etc) should accomodate this by specifically asking what you want to be identified as.
- I also think it's fair for those same entities to ask about your genetics (Are you male, female, or neither? If neither, what kind of neither are you?)

Of course, this is my stance right now. If I learn information that results in me changing my mind, then I will do so. I'm a "strong opinions, weakly held" kind of person.
