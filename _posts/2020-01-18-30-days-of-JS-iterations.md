I'm doing 30 Days of JavaScript (hyperlink) course by Wes Bos. 

Fun fact: I have a Computer Science B.S. and 2 years of web development experience.

Hence, you might ask: Isn't this a cake walk for you?

Yes, and, embarassingly, no.

When I look at the source code, nothing's really new. Div's, for loops - got it.

That being said, if you asked me to build any of those projects from scratch without looking at the source code..

I'd be hopelessly lost.

I've never felt like a bona-fide web developer for that reason.

At all my internships and jobs, I've never had to build anything from scratch. I fixed bugs and added new features on existing codebases.

When I was starting out, the advice I got was typically along the lines of: "Just jump in, learn by doing, don't worry about the little details at first - you'll pick it up!"

I delivered, but the entire time I was walking on eggshells of abstractions, feeling overwhelmed.

I succeeded in getting started and ultimately delivering, but the problem was: I never learned good foundations.

Completing tasks always took longer than they should have, and once I was finished, it didn't feel like I learned anything. I didn't really understand the big picture, so a lot of my work involved copy and pasting what "looked right" from StackOverflow, and then getting frustrated when it didn't work and I had no idea where to go from there, except back to google, HOPING to find the line that would actually work.

I hated my work. I wasn't proud of it. It wasn't meaningful. It felt eternally broken. Every line I added to it just felt like adding fuel to a bigger dumpster fire.

So, I dreamed of greener pastures:

- Going back to school for my M.S.
- Switching to "data science" (whatever that meant, it sounded cool)

And I did. I quit my job as a web developer and went back to school.

But, I ran into the same problem munging data and building machine learning models.

I jumped in and got overwhelmed.

But I already quit my job and was halfway through the M.S. - so I figured I might as well finish it. Maybe it'd get better.

I'm two classes away, and I still feel the same.

Why?

No foundation.

It made me think: Well, shoot. Maybe I was doing it wrong. Maybe I didn't give web dev a proper chance. Plus, I miss it. I missed building things. Websites, specifically. I missed building something and releasing it to the world, where people could interact with it and benefit from it.

So that's my goal. To not only be able to build websites from scratch, but to do it FAST. I want to be one of those prodigies where code flows from their fingers faster than they can speak it.

And in order to do that, I need the intuition. I need both the big picture AND the micro details. Not to mention: a CRAP ton of practice. I also need to start from the beginning.
