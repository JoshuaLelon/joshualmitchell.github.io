I'm doing a blog series inspired by the [30 Days of JavaScript](https://javascript30.com/) course by Wes Bos.

This post will serve as its kickoff introduction. I'll talk a little about my struggle for a rewarding development career, the issues I ran into, and how I hope this will help solve them for anyone reading this.

## Finding something I enjoy (and am good at)

Fun fact: I have a Computer Science B.S. and 2 years of web development experience.

You might ask: Vanilla JS. Isn't this a cake walk for you?

Yes, and embarassingly, no.

When I look at the [source code](https://github.com/wesbos/JavaScript30), the individual pieces are familiar. Div's, for loops - got it.

However, if you asked me to build any of those projects from scratch without looking at the source code..

I'd be hopelessly lost.

"Just jump in, learn by doing, don't worry about the little details at first - you'll pick it up!"

It seemed to work. I ended up fixing some bugs and adding new features during my internships.

However, the entire time, I felt like I was walking on eggshells of abstractions, constantly feeling overwhelmed.

Everything took longer than it should have, I wasn't confident in the code I pushed, and I didn't feel like I was getting better.

I had a similar experience with each job I took, and it made me hate going to work.

So, I dreamed of greener pastures. 

Machine Learning sounded cool, so I left my web development job and went to grad school to pivot into data science.

Much to my chagrin, I ran into the same problem learning to munge data and build models.

I jumped in and got overwhelmed. The novelty wore off, and it stopped being fun. Same story.

I hoped it would get better as I perservered. However, fast-forward 2 years to today, I still feel the same (despite being almost finished with my Master's).

What's going on?

## The Issues

To boil it down into one sentence:

Not enough *good* practice.

I never achieved the instinct and confidence that comes from lots of deliberate and increasingly challenging practice.

I took multiple choice tests when I should have been writing programs from scratch.

My assignments had parts a, b, c, and d, when they should have been one sentence prompts (i.e. more vague)

Feedback came three weeks later in the form of a checkmark, when I needed it to be instantaneous and actionable.

I should have kept taking away the training wheels until I could make complex applications from scratch, but I [stopped when I learned enough to get an A](http://www.paulgraham.com/lesson.html) (which was suprisingly little).

I crammed, which made me forget once I took the test.

I didn't have a good foundation.

## How this can help

I want to become an *excellent* web developer (a 10x programmer?) - the kind of folks that can crank out *good* (modular, well tested, etc) code at [speeds only limited by how fast they can type it](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2006/10/25/the-guerrilla-guide-to-interviewing-version-30/).

In order to get there, I think the solution is to practice building websites from scratch, starting with the basics.

My goal is, for each "day" of 30 Days of JavaScript:

- look at the end result (but not the source code),
- build a MVP version, and
- keep iterating until I get to the same functionality

All while documenting the whole process.

I definitely advocate practicing by building from scratch, [so you force lots of recall](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/ultralearning/), but I wanted to put this out there because blogs that discuss software engineering tradeoffs in context are actually kind of rare (but incredibly useful).

I hope you gain some value from this series! Please feel free to reach out with any suggestions or comments (contact info on the left)!
