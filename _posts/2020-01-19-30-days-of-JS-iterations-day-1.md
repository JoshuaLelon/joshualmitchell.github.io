This is day 1 of a blog series breaking down each site from [30 Days of JavaScript](https://javascript30.com/). You can find the how and why [here](https://lelon.io/tutorial/30-days-of-JS-iterations/).

## Goal

[Here](https://github.com/wesbos/JavaScript30/blob/master/01%20-%20JavaScript%20Drum%20Kit/index-FINISHED.html)'s the complete source code I'm aiming for, and [here](https://jsfiddle.net/joshualmitchell/79huedon/11/) it is in action.

Long story short: Create a digital keyboard that plays sounds when keys are pressed.

## Iteration 1

As is tradition, I started out with [Hello World!](https://jsfiddle.net/joshualmitchell/r14nk89v/6/)

Just boilerplate (DOCTYPE, head, body, title) and the audio elements (I wasn't about to type the URL sources from scratch).

## Iteration 2

Made a basic button looking object!

## Iteration 3

Made the basic button more fancy:

## Iteration 4

Added a description of what the button will do:

## Iteration 5

https://jsfiddle.net/joshualmitchell/65r3zxov/14/

Added a function that plays a sound, and attached that function to a 'keydown' event, so that pressing the key plays the sound.
