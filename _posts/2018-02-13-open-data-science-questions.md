title: "Open (Usually Data Science) Questions"
date: 2018-02-23
---

As I'm learning and doing research, I often have a lot of questions that I silently ask myself. A lot of them get answered as I read further, but some of them don't.

And then they just linger in my self-conscious.

As an instructor, when a student has a question but doesn't ask it, it frustrates me because it really helps me understand what I'm not communicating effectively (as well as where the knowledge gaps are). As a student, it frustrates me because sometimes I have the same question but forget to ask it (or it just never occured to me).

In any case, this knowledge is valuable, and I feel that I could add a lot of value to the lives of anyone learning data science simply by listing all the questions that come to mind, as well as answers to them when I get them.

So, in chronological order, from now on, I'm going to list any questions I have (or come across). Then, as I have both the answers and the time, I'll put them here as well. If the question has just a number (i.e. Question 3) then it's not a question I came up with, just one I saw somewhere (e.g. an interview question). If it has an M (e.g. Question 1M) it's a question I thought of myself.

### Question 1M (02/13/2018): How do hypothesis tests factor into predictive models? It seems like we just don't care about them when they could add some amount of information.

### Question 2M (02/14/2018): What happens when you do some dimensionality reduction technique on a picture? (i.e. you think of the columns or rows of the picture matrix as features and the other one as samples) - is there a way to do this meaningfully? Can lossy compression algorithms on pictures be thought of as dimensionality reduction? Or is there a meaningful difference?

### Question 3 (02/15/2018): What is an auto-encoder? Why do we "auto-encode"? Hint: it's really a misnomer.

### Question 4 (02/15/2018): What is a Boltzmann Machine? Why a Boltzmann Machine?

### Question 5 (02/15/2018): Why do we use sigmoid for an output function? Why tanh? Why not cosine? Why any function in particular?

### Question 6 (02/16/2018): Why are CNNs used primarily in imaging and not so much other tasks?

### Question 7 (02/17/2018): Explain backpropagation simply.

### Question 8 (02/18/2018): Is it OK to connect from a Layer 4 output back to a Layer 2 input?

### Question 9 (02/19/2018): A data-scientist person recently put up a YouTube video explaining that the essential difference between a Neural Network and a Deep Learning network is that the former is trained from output back to input, while the latter is trained from input toward output. Do you agree? Explain.

### Question 10 (02/19/2018): Implement dropout during forward and backward pass?
### Question 11 (02/19/2018): Neural network training loss/testing loss stays constant, what do you do?
### Question 12 (02/19/2018): Why do RNNs have a tendency to suffer from exploding/vanishing gradient? How do you prevent this?
### Question 13 (02/19/2018): Does using full batch means that the convergence is always better given unlimited power?
### Question 14 (02/19/2018): What is the problem with sigmoid during backpropagation?
### Question 15 (02/19/2018): Given a black box machine learning algorithm that you canâ€™t modify, how could you improve its error?
### Question 16 (02/19/2018): How to find the best hyper parameters?

### Question 17 (02/19/2018): How do you treat missing values? What're the pros and cons of using mean, median, K-NN imputation, regression, etc?
### Question 18 (02/19/2018): How do you treat outliers? What're the pros and cons of replacement by quartile values, max or min etc.
### Question 19 (02/19/2018): What're Near Zero Variance predictors? How do you deal with them?
### Question 20 (02/19/2018): What is the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)?
### Question 21 (02/19/2018): What does correlation between numerical-numerical variables, categorical-categorical, categorical and numerical variables mean? What do you do about it? How do you find out it's there?
### Question 22 (02/19/2018): What're some different types of transformations, what do they do, and when should you do them? (i.e. normalization and variable transformations like x^2 -> z)
### Question 23 (02/19/2018): What're some different sampling techniques and when/why should you use each of them? Pros and cons? (e.g. simple random sampling, stratified sampling)
### Question 24 (02/19/2018): What is hypothesis testing? When/why should you do it? What're the popular hypothesis tests and what do they test? 
### Question 25 (02/19/2018): What is feature selection/ extraction? Why do you do it? How do you do it?
### Question 26 (02/19/2018): What're the pros and cons of each of these feature selection techniques: Lasso regression, Ridge regression, Subset selection, Random forest
### Question 27 (02/19/2018): Regression in a nutshell. What're the different types, assumptions, mistakes, indicators, etc? (i.e. Simple / Multiple LR, GLMs, R^2, RMSE, Adj R^2, Predicted R^2, Lasso / Ridge Regression, Regularization, Over/Underfitting, Learning Rate, Bias/Variance Tradeoff...)
### Question 28 (02/19/2018): Classification in a nutshell. What're the different types, assumptions, mistakes, indicators, etc? (i.e. K-NN, Logistic Regression with ROC curve and selection of optimal threshold, Decision trees, Bagging / Random Forrests, SVMs, Bayes Classifier, Boosting (e.g. Xgboost, Adaboost), ANNs (perceptron, MLP, etc), performance measures like confusion matrix, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, F-Measure, Recall, F1)
### Question 29 (02/19/2018): Clustering in a nutshell. What're the different types, assumptions, mistakes, indicators, etc? (e.g. K-Means, distance and dissimilarity measures (for both numerical and non-numerical types of variables), Hierarchical clustering, maybe a few others)
### Question 30 (02/19/2018): Dimensionality Reduction in a nutshell. What're the different types, assumptions, mistakes, indicators, etc? (e.g. PCA, Kernel-PCA, etc)
### Question 31 (02/19/2018): What is KKT and what're it's conditions?
### Question 32 (02/19/2018): What is Laplace Approximation and what's it used for?
