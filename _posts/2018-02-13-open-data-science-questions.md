title: "Open (Usually Data Science) Questions"

As I'm learning and doing research, I often have a lot of questions that I silently ask myself. A lot of them get answered as I read further, but some of them don't.

And then they just linger in my self-conscious.

As an instructor, when a student has a question but doesn't ask it, it frustrates me because it really helps me understand what I'm not communicating effectively (as well as where the knowledge gaps are). As a student, it frustrates me because sometimes I have the same question but forget to ask it (or it just never occured to me).

In any case, this knowledge is valuable, and I feel that I could add a lot of value to the lives of anyone learning data science simply by listing all the questions that come to mind, as well as answers to them when I get them.

So, in chronological order, from now on, I'm going to list any questions I have that I don't immediately think of an answer to. Then, at probably not the same pace, I'm going to answer them.
