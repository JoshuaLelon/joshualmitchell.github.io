As someone who has had periodic (*and highly variable*) spurts of productivity, but never managed to isolate a good system for consistent, long-term results: I think I've finally found what works for me.

I'm posting this write-up on it in hopes that it helps others. 

## Observations

On my most unproductive days, here's what would happen:

1. Inspiration strikes
2. Planning begins
3. Anxiety sets in
4. Procrastination (due to anxiety)
5. Time flies
6. Sun goes down: too late to do anything now
7. Sun comes up, go to 1. 

## Problems

1. Distractions were numerous: Hacker News, Twitter, Reddit, etc.

2. Inspiration was common, but also fickle: I'd be inspired to do one project, work on it for a day or two, and then be inspired to do something else.

3. I loved consuming information but had a lot of anxiety applying it and working on projects.

## Solutions

### 1: Distractions

- I couldn't trust myself to not go on reddit et al., so I bought a subscription to [Freedom](https://freedom.to/). You give it some sites and times and it blocks you from visiting those sites at those times with a VPN. I gave myself 1 hour of reddit et al a day.

(sidenote: Freedom isn't available on Linux yet. Workaround: edit your /etc/hosts file and add sites. Does the same thing, but easier to get around.)

- I emailed [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/) about this. He gave me the following advice:
    1. move all your distracting apps (*including your default browser*) into a folder as far away from your home screen as you can (*so you have to swipe multiple times to get to that page of apps*)
    2. disable those apps from appearing in your recently used section (*to avoid temptation to open them again*)
    3. download Firefox Focus (*which makes you manually type out all your websites instead of remembering them*).

### 2: Inspiration

Limiting distractions resulted in more productivity, but also an unexpected side effect:

I didn't get random spurts of inspiration from various cool tech threads that pushed me towards other projects.

### 3: Anxiety

My anxiety came from 4 sources:

1. Memory: I felt like whatever I was doing would have to become THE THING that I do from now on, otherwise I'd forget it when I moved onto something else and it'd all be a waste of time.
2. Getting Stuck: I hated getting things wrong and subsequently getting stuck (i.e. not able to learn from it)
3. Vanishing Motivation: I felt like I needed to finish each project quickly because otherwise the motivation would vanish, I'd abandon the project, and it'd all be for nothing.
4. Context Switching: I hated having to context switch between learning, planning, and doing.

#### Memory

A lot of this fear and stress simply came from not knowing how to learn. Reading [Ultralearning](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/ultralearning/) really helped.

Long story short: all I ever did in college was passively take notes during lectures and then skim them right before tests. I unconsciously believed that's what learning was.

When you dig into the material and actually build a solid foundation, it sticks a lot easier. The biggest gain for me came from forcing myself to recall what I learned (instead of just reading it).

Also, for the stuff that didn't stick as well, [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) (digital flashcards) came in handy. I was inspired by [Michael Nielsen's post](http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html).

#### Getting Stuck

It turns out that solving my memory problem also helped me with getting stuck. I often got stuck because I "learned" the fundamentals but then got lost when I went deeper. I didn't know where to go or what to do next because my foundation sucked.

#### Vanishing Motivation

Again, it turns out that my motivation died BECAUSE I kept getting stuck. Solving memory solved getting stuck which solved my motivation problem. Once I realized I could get past obstacles, my motivation came back.

#### Context Switching

This was hard to eliminate entirely, since life is chaotic, but implementing formal project management really helped.

I resisted for a long time because it seemed like

1. a pain (*you mean I have to sketch out the entire thing, divvy up tasks, and all this stuff before I get to the fun part?*), and

2. a waste of time (*why spend time jotting down what I'm going to do instead of doing it?*)

However, it turns out:

1. It doesn't have to be a pain: you don't have to plan EVERYTHING out, just the next step. Resist the temptation to follow the planning momentum and plan the next step and the next step and etc.

2. It takes like 2 minutes and is, most definitely, not a waste of time.

I spent about 2 hours learning [Emacs Org-Mode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQS06Qjnkcc&list=PLVtKhBrRV_ZkPnBtt_TD1Cs9PJlU0IIdE&index=1), and it's GREAT!

It allows me to divide projects into their respective Planning, Learning, and Doing phases really effectively.

First, I'll flesh it out with org-mode.

Then, I'll learn what I need to know (with the context in mind from the plan).

Finally, I'll do.

The key here is: I don't feel overwhelmed because I know that

1. everything is accounted for, and

2. I can look at each task one step at a time and not think about anything else.

So yeah, that's my system. Hope it helps!
