I'm really excited.

As someone who has had periodic (*and highly variable*) spurts of productivity but never managed to isolate a good system for consistent, long-term results - I think I've finally found what works for me. I'm posting this write-up on it in hopes that it helps others. 

## Problems

1. I loved consuming information but was particularly resistant to gaining knowledge (i.e. *browsing reddit vs learning math*)

2. Inspiration was common, but also fickle: I'd be inspired to do one project, work on it for a day or two, and then be inspired to do something else. Rinse and repeat indefinitely.

3. How productive I was tended to correlate negatively with how much I had to do and how hard/intangible it was.

4. Distractions were numerous: Quora, Hacker News, LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, etc.

## Observations

A lot of these problems turned out to be interwoven with each other. When I broke it down, this is what kept happening:

- I'd either be assigned some work to do or be inspired to learn or do something.
- If the work wasn't already daunting, in my head I'd start imagining (*unconsciously*) what would make it "acceptable" and/or "worth telling my friends about" and/or "good enough".
- Usually this list of requirements I came up with would then become daunting.
- After realizing its daunting-ness, I'd get anxious and start rationalizing procrastination.
- Seeing the clock after an hour or two of burrying my head in the sand resulted in more anxiety, thus more procrastination.
- Rinse and repeat until night-time (*at which point I get too tired to care, and then fall asleep*).

## Solutions

My system clearly needed a lot of work, but it turned out to have 2 main holes I had to plug:

### Eliminate Distractions

- I couldn't trust myself to not go on reddit et al., so I bought a subscription to [Freedom](https://freedom.to/). You give it a list of sites you don't want to visit and the times you don't want to visit them, and it disables them at those times (*at the VPN level, so it doesn't matter what browser you use*). I specifically set it to only let me go on distracting sites between 6pm and 7pm (until I learn self control I suppose).
- Unfortunately, Freedom isn't available on Linux yet. However, I discovered that you can just edit your /etc/hosts file and add any sites there you don't want to visit (e.g. 127.0.0.1    facebook.com). Does mostly the same thing, but easier to get around.
- I emailed [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/) about this, and he said some other stuff he does is
    1. move all your distracting apps (*including your default browser*) into as deeply nested of a folder you can (only 1 level on iOS) as far away from your home screen as you can (*so you have to swipe multiple times to get to that page of apps*)
    2. disable those apps from appearing in your recently used section (*to avoid temptation to open them again*) and
    3. download Firefox Focus (*which makes you manually type out all your websites instead of remembering them*).

Ultimately, the idea was to set up as many barriers as possible to distracting stuff. These worked pretty well.

A side effect of eliminating the distractions meant that I didn't get random spurts of inspiration from various cool tech threads I found on reddit/HN, and instead got spurts of information from seeing myself succeed in whatever project I was doing (*which didn't pull me away to other things*).

So that took care of problems 2 and 4, here's how I dealt with 1 and 3:

### Set Up Formal Project Management

I resisted using a personal project management tool for a long time because it seemed like

(1) a pain (*you mean I have to sketch out the entire thing, divvy up tasks, and all this stuff before I get to the fun part?*) and

(2) a waste of time (*why spend time jotting down what I'm going to do instead of doing it?*).

However, I realized that I made it out to be a demanding taskmaster demon in my head when really it should be perceived as a helpful, guiding angel.

First, I had to mentally decouple all the stuff I needed to do from what I should be doing right this second.

Second, I had to take all the big/complex/abstract stuff and break it into small, actionable bits (*I know this is what all the productivity people have been saying for ages...*).

Third, I had to start recording anything I needed to do so that it didn't fade into obscurity and stress me out because I forgot what it was / how important it was.

The project management I ended up using is called [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/). It costs money, but I totally played the student card and they gave it to me for free (for a year) when I emailed them.

My golden goose daily routine is now:

- Exercise (*did I mention exercise and not eating B.S. food helps a lot too? Seriously.*)
- Eat while reviewing my [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) deck (*another great tool for learning and not forgetting what you learned*)
- Do the morning tasks I assigned myself last night in Basecamp
- At 12:30pm, take a break, check email, and assign myself more tasks if I finished them all
- at 5:30pm, at this point I've probably thought of more stuff to do later, so I'll add these tasks to the big to-do list and break down the big ones into actionable chunks.
- Finally, before I end my work day, I'll assign myself a reasonable, digestible, and manageable amount of tasks to do the next morning.

During this whole time, if I think of something I need to do, I add it to the big to-do list, and if I learn something new, I'll Ankify it (*make flashcards*). 

The two key things that help fix problems 1 and 3 are:

- I no longer have unknown / unforgotten tasks that might be important eating away at me subconsciously
- At any given time, what's on my plate is always manageable and easy to create momentum
- I might have a massive to-do list, but when I'm actually working, I always make sure I never look at that list and only look at the manageable, approachable "morning" or "afternoon" list (*since looking at the big list stresses me out*).
- Any due dates are always accounted for, so once 6pm comes around I can mentally check out and recharge for the day (I learned that and more from Dr. Calvin Newport's book: [Deep Work](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted/dp/1455586692))
- With the majority of the stress and pressure gone, creating and learning became fun again! :)

So yeah, that's my system. Hope it helps!
