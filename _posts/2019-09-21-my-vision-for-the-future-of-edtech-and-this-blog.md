It blows my mind that EdTech isn't the NUMBER ONE place people who want to make a difference in the world start jumping on.

Why?

Imagine if we had 100x more scientists, engineers, creators. People who invented things like penicillin, the rocket, the MRI, GPS, etc. 

100 more Elon Musk's, 100 more Alexander Fleming's.

What if we had the cure for cancer 50 years from now, but only if the right person learned the right things?

How could we get there? How do we get 100x more people who know how to solve these kinds of problems?

EDUCATION AT SCALE!

Imagine an app. For kids, adults, anyone.

You can pick whatever you want to learn. Or youâ€™ll be recommended some topics.

You click your choice, and there it is. A curriculum, just for you.

It tailors it to your proficiency level. It's as engaging as social media and video games. It's REALLY effective at teaching. It has all the credentialing attached (so employers respect it).

And it's available to anyone with internet access, globally.

We consider stuff like intergalactic travel, teleportation, automatic wound regeneration, etc to be absolute sorcery right now, but, at one point, so was flying.

Then, planes were invented. Now, we complain about the TSA.

That's why I'm passionate about EdTech. Intergalactic travel isn't feasible right now, but education at scale TOTALLY IS!

If done right, if a system was invented that

- has a community aspect (feedback loops, discussion, help)
- is challenging (i.e. won't let you get past modules without actually knowing stuff)
- is engaging (i.e. automatically tailors to your learning style, level, and pace)
- is interesting (i.e. sells you on why you should learn what you're learning, gives you chances to be creative)

The world would enter a true golden age. I want to do my part in creating this system.
