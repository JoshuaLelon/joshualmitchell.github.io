## Intro

I've always been passively "interested in real estate" - but when I sat down and thought about what that meant, it dissolved mostly into, "I'd really like to just own a bunch of $REAL_ESTATE_PROPERTIES, rent them out, and live off the profit." I imagine I'm not alone in that regard - there are probably a ton of "wannabe" real-estate moguls like me. 

Whether or not I decide to develop that interest later, I'd still like to ask some questions and look at some numbers (using the [Zillow Prize Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/zillow-prize-1/data)). To set the direction of this project, I'd like to know:

- In general, what makes a house expensive?
- Over time, what correlates with rising house values? 
- When's the best time to buy a house?
- Where's the best place to buy a house?
- How much of an impact do surrounding municipal/residential/commercial entities have on the value of a house?

I'll be updating this as I make progress on it.

## Day 1: 06/17/2018

After taking a closer look at the data and what some people have done, it seems like most of what could be done with this dataset has [already](https://www.kaggle.com/philippsp/exploratory-analysis-zillow) [been](https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/simple-exploration-notebook-zillow-prize) [done](https://www.kaggle.com/captcalculator/a-very-extensive-zillow-exploratory-analysis). I have to be honest, it does kill some of the motivation I have for this project, and makes it feel more like a regular school assignment. That being said, it's still a great opportunity to learn from the pros. I just need to mentally switch gears from "exploring new ground" to "learning the craft" - which is somewhat less fun now but will allow me to have more fun later.

I want to make this post both informative and novel, so I'll import my favorite kernel (above) here and fill in any gaps I see. In other words, I'll take advantage of my unfamiliarity by picking things that didn't immediately make sense to me, learning them, and then explaining them here.
