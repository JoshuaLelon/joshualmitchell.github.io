I've always been passively "interested in real estate" - but when I sat down and thought about what that meant, it dissolved mostly into, "I'd really like to just own a bunch of houses, rent them out, and live off the profit." I imagine I'm not alone in that regard - there are probably a ton of "wannabe" real-estate moguls like me. 

Whether or not I decide to develop that interest later, I'd still like to ask some questions and look at some numbers (using the Zillow Prize dataset). To set the direction of this project, I'd like to know:

- In general, what makes a house expensive?
- Over time, what correlates with rising house values? 
- When's the best time to buy a house?
- Where's the best place to buy a house?
- How much of an impact do surrounding municipal/residential/commercial entities have on the value of a house?

I'll be updating this as I make progress on it.
