title: "Productivity, Concentration, and Time Series"

I know next to nothing about time series at the moment, but I plan on learning about it somewhat soon.

I also really want to know what correlates with my productivity, but since bodies, habits, health issues, etc tend to change over time, it sounds like a time series problem (I think). Even if it isn't, I feel like it's worth doing.

So, I'm thinking that I can kill two birds with one stone by first taking some time to collect data (a few months at least), and then looking at what correlates with what.

Here's what I want to track per day. These are features I feel might be correlated with how well my meditation goes and how much work I get done.

Note: the 1-10 scale means 1 being absolute worst, 10 being absolute best.

- how well my meditation went (scale: 1-10). For example, was it fulfilling, did I get in the zone, did it "work"
- how much deep work I got done (scale: minutes)
- how much shallow work I got done (scale: minutes)
- how much work I was excited about that I got done (scale: minutes)
- how much work I was lukewarm about that I got done (scale: minutes)
- how much work I was not looking forward to at all that I got done (scale: minutes), noted as resistant work.
- how healthy I ate that day (scale: 1-10). Note: my definition of healthy, for the sake of simplicity, is consuming as little processed foods and junk food as possible.
- how much exercise I got (scale: minutes)
- step count (scale: number of steps) according to fitbit.
- weight (scale: pounds), this is each morning after I use the bathroom.
- how much time I spent in each sleep stage (scale: hours) the night before according to fitbit. This includes Awake, REM, Light, and Deep stages.
