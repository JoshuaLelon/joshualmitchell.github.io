(this post is veeery incomplete, and will see lots of additions and revisions over the next few months)

### Summary:

Most folks new to drawing struggle with proportions. Learning from mistakes is difficult (or, at least, cumbersome) since it's hard to tell exactly where you went wrong. An OK solution is to take a picture of what you drew and overlay a semitransparent version of it over what you wanted to draw and see exactly where your attempt differs. However, if you're actively practicing and you want to fail fast, this can be a pain. 

Drawing Guide does (well, will do) all of this automatically. All you have to do is take the pictures.

Eventually, I want to bring AI into the picture and find patterns in what you (as the user) tend to mess up, and then automatically generate pictures for you to draw. The idea is that they'll start off really easy (since they're the embodiment of your weakness), and then get progressively harder until it's no longer your weakest link. At that point, some other "weakness" will be capitalized on.
