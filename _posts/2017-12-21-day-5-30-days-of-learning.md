Today I actually spent the vast majority of the time working on my <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/joshualmitchell/DrawingGuide">DrawingGuide</a> app. I finally formalized the cost function for the drawing comparisons and listed out each partial derivative for the gradient descent update rule.

I'm also counting this towards the 30 days of learning in terms of the sci-kit learn / tf book because I'll also be using numpy and other ML libraries extensively for this project.
