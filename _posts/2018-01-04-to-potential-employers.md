Welcome. Thank you for your consideration.

This page serves to augment my resume (by providing more details).

Most of my professional work exerience is related to software development, but since I'm moving towards a data science / engineering related career, I'm going to emphasize my data-related experience, which is mostly from academia and personal projects.

## Core Technical Skills

### Data Science:

*In a nutshell*: Python (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, opencv, pytorch), R, SQL, Matlab, Bash scripting, git, *nix, LaTeX.

I've done several projects that required cleaning/wrangling, pipelining, analyzing, and presenting data. (Details below, in Projects section.)

These are at a pretty small scale though (Kilobytes).

My next project will have a focus on Big(ger) Data (i.e. learning to use Spark, Hive, etc) and visualization (i.e. learning to use d3.js, Tableau, etc).

Down the road (probably Fall 2018) I also plan on diving into parallel programming, distributed systems, and containerization (Docker) as they relate to Data Science projects.

### Other:

*In a nutshell*: Java, HTML/CSS/JavaScript, Angular.js, Python (Flask), Jekyll/Markdown (for example, this site).

I've done several projects and professional work in the areas of front-end Angular development, server-side Java development, and mobile development (using Ionic and React Native).

A quick caveat: it has been several years since I've used some of this technology. I don't foresee any problems picking it back up if I need to, but I probably won't be able to confidently answer specific questions about some of it.

## Education

*Currently*, I'm pursuing a __Master of Science (M.S.)__ in __Computer Science__ at __Texas State University__ with a concentration in __Analytics__ and __Machine Learning__.

I'm being co-advised by [Dr. Jelena Tesic](https://cs.txstate.edu/accounts/profiles/j_t463/) (Computer Science Department) and [Dr. Lucas Rusnak](http://www.math.txstate.edu/people/faculty/rusnak.html) (Mathematics Department).

My current GPA is a __3.75__, and I'm scheduled to graduate in the Spring of 2019.

*Previously*, I obtained a __Bachelor of Science (B.S.)__ in __Computer Science__ at __Texas State University__ with a __3.63__ GPA in the Spring of 2016.

## Career Experience

Since __August 2017__ (about 5 months so far), I've been a __Graduate Instructional Assistant__ (a TA, essentially) for the __Mathematics Department__ at __Texas State University__. In Fall 2017 I taught a Pre-Calculus lab, and in Spring 2018 I expect to teach a Calculus I lab (although, that's subject to change). Responsibilities include lecturing on course content and developing, administering, and grading homework assignments and quizzes.

From __June 2016 to August 2017__ (1 year, 3 months), I was a __Software Developer__ at __General Motors Company (GMC)__. I was part of a team that developed a new mobile-first web application for factory workers in 60+ factories to keep track of parts on assembly lines. Some specific contributions included writing unit tests for the Java backend (specifically: bringing code coverage up to ~90%-95%), and later adding Angular.js routes and pages to the front end.

From __September 2015 to May 2016__ (9 months), I was a __Co-Op Software Engineer__ (an intern, essentially) at __International Business Machines (IBM) Corporation__. I was part of a team of six co-op software engineers that worked with mostly back-end and mobile technologies (Node.js, Angular.js, HTML/CSS/JS, and the Ionic framework, specifically). Our main focus was to help redesign a mobile application that supplied the user with updates about the status of various servers and sent notifications in the event of any changes.
