Welcome. Thank you for your consideration.

This page serves to augment my resume (by providing more details).

Most of my professional work exerience is related to software development, but since I'm moving towards a data science / engineering related career, I'm going to emphasize that experience (which is mostly from academia / personal projects).

## Projects

| Project | Status | Problem / Goal | Technology | Methods |
|:-------------|:---------------------|:----------------|:--------------|:-------------------|
| TBA | Not Started | TBA | __Big Data Ecosystem__ (Spark, Hive, Pig, HBase, Cassandra, Kafka, Redis, etc), __Visualization Tech__ (d3.js, Tableau) | TBA |
| [Zillow (Kaggle Competition)](https://github.com/joshualmitchell/Zillow) | Just Started | Predict the price of a house (Zestimate) based on its various features | __Python__ (Jupyter Notebooks, NumPy, SciPy, matplotlib/Seaborn, Pandas) | Linear Regression, Decision Trees |
| [DrawingGuide](https://github.com/joshualmitchell/DrawingGuide) | In Progress | Give the user feedback on his/her drawing by superimposing an attempted image over a target image and highlighting the differences | __Python__ (Jupyter Notebooks, Scikit-Image, Pillow, OpenCV, NumPy, SciPy, matplotlib, Pandas) | Gradient Descent |
| [Cars-MPG](https://github.com/joshualmitchell/joshualmitchell.github.io/tree/master/MATH5345/proj) | Finished* | Predict a car's MPG based on its various features | __R__ (leaps, car, xtable, locfit), __RStudio__ | Linear Regression |
| [log-to-csv](https://github.com/joshualmitchell/log_to_csv )| Finished* | In order to better diagnose my old Windows machine's freezes, I wrote a script to convert the Windows wevtuti event log into a CSV file for easier analysis | __Python__ (and other standard libraries like os and json) | Various parsing and cleaning of text |

``*``Not necessarily forever - just, for now.
