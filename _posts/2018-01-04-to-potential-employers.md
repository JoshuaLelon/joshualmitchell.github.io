Welcome. Thank you for your consideration.

This page serves to augment my resume (by providing more details).

Most of my professional work exerience is related to software development, but since I'm moving towards a data science / engineering related career, I'm going to emphasize my data-related experience, which is mostly from academia and personal projects.
