Welcome to my site, and thank you for considering me as a candidate. This page serves as a tool to augment my resume by giving a more detailed description of my skills and experience.

Most of my professional work exerience is related to software development, but since I'm moving towards a data science / engineering related career, I'm going to emphasize that experience (which is mostly from academia / personal projects).

I'll start by giving a table with a list of projects, their status, the problem they aim to solve / goal they aim to achieve, the technology they use, and any special methods / techniques they use.

I will also frequently update this page (although you're welcome to check my LINK [GitHub](https://github.com/joshualmitchell) for the source code).

| Project | Status | Problem / Goal | Technology | Methods |
| TBA | Not Started | TBA | Big Data Ecosystem (Spark, Hive, Pig, HBase, Cassandra, Kafka, Redis, etc), Bigger focus on visualization (i.e. d3.js, Tableau) | TBA |
| [Zillow (Kaggle Competition)](https://github.com/joshualmitchell/Zillow) | Just Started | Predict the price of a house (Zestimate) based on its various features | Python (Jupyter Notebooks, NumPy, SciPy, matplotlib/Seaborn, Pandas) | Linear Regression, Decision Trees |
| [DrawingGuide](https://github.com/joshualmitchell/DrawingGuide) | In Progress | Give the user feedback on his/her drawing by superimposing an attempted image over a target image and highlighting the differences | Python (Jupyter Notebooks, Scikit-Image, Pillow, OpenCV, NumPy, SciPy, matplotlib, Pandas) | Gradient Descent |
| [Cars-MPG](https://github.com/joshualmitchell/joshualmitchell.github.io/tree/master/MATH5345/proj) | Finished* | Predict a car's MPG based on its various features | R (leaps, car, xtable, locfit), RStudio | Linear Regression |
| [log-to-csv](https://github.com/joshualmitchell/log_to_csv )| Finished* | In order to better diagnose my old Windows machine's freezes, I wrote a script to convert the Windows wevtuti event log into a CSV file for easier analysis | Python (and other standard libraries like os and json) | Various parsing and cleaning of text |

The truth is that none of these are ever really finished*. There's always more to do (clean up code, new features, etc), so I really mean, "I don't plan on touching this again anytime soon."
